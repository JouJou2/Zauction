            <h1 class="mb-4">Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="text-graphite text-lg mb-12">Conditions of sale and use</p>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">By registering for an account, placing bids, or using Zauction's services, you agree to
                    be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use our
                    services.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this
                    page with an updated effective date. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes
                    acceptance of the modified terms.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">2. Bidding and Purchase</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">All bids are binding commitments to purchase. By placing a bid, you agree to pay the
                    hammer price plus buyer's premium, applicable taxes, and shipping costs if you are the winning
                    bidder.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Bids cannot be retracted once submitted. We reserve the right to reject bids, cancel
                    sales, or refuse service to any bidder at our discretion.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Reserve prices may apply to certain lots. If bidding does not reach the reserve, the lot
                    will not be sold.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">3. Payment</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Payment is due within 7 days of the auction closing. Accepted methods include bank
                    transfer, credit card (with 3% processing fee), and certified check.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Lots will not be released until payment is received in full and has cleared. Late
                    payments incur a fee of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Failure to pay may result in account suspension, legal action, and reporting to credit
                    agencies.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">4. Buyer's Premium</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">A buyer's premium is added to the hammer price of each lot. The premium percentage is
                    stated in each auction's terms and typically ranges from 20% to 25%.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">5. Condition and Authenticity</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">All lots are sold as-is, where-is, with all faults. Buyers are responsible for examining
                    lots and forming their own opinions about condition and authenticity.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Condition reports are provided as a courtesy and are not exhaustive. We do not guarantee
                    that condition reports include all defects or issues.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We do not guarantee attribution, age, authenticity, or provenance unless explicitly
                    stated in writing. Catalogue descriptions represent our opinion based on examination and research at
                    the time of cataloguing.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">6. Returns and Refunds</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">All sales are final. Returns are accepted only in cases of material
                    misrepresentation—where the lot is proven to be a forgery or fundamentally different from the
                    catalogue description.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Return claims must be made in writing within 30 days of delivery and supported by
                    credible expert opinion. Items must be returned in the same condition as sold.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If a return is approved, the buyer will receive a refund of the hammer price only.
                    Buyer's premium, shipping costs, and expert fees are non-refundable.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">7. Shipping and Risk of Loss</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Buyers are responsible for arranging and paying for shipping, packing, and insurance.
                    Risk of loss transfers to the buyer upon payment clearance.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We are not responsible for damage or loss occurring during transit or after items leave
                    our facility.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Our liability is limited to the hammer price paid for a lot. We are not liable for
                    consequential, incidental, or punitive damages.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the merchantability or fitness for
                    a particular purpose of any lot.</p>
            </section>

                <p class="mb-4">You agree not to engage in fraudulent bidding, bid manipulation, or any activity that
                    disrupts auctions or harms other users.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these terms or

                    through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

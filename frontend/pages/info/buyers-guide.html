            <h1 class="mb-4">Buyer's Guide</h1>
            <p class="text-graphite text-lg mb-12">What you should know before bidding</p>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Before You Bid</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Carefully review the lot description, condition report, and photographs. Read the
                    auction terms, including the buyer's premium percentage and payment deadline.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you have questions about a lot, contact the appropriate specialist department before
                    bidding. We can provide additional photographs, measurements, or clarification on condition issues.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">Consider arranging a viewing if the lot is of significant value or if condition details
                    are critical to your decision.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Understanding Estimates</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Each lot includes a pre-sale estimate range (e.g., $2,000-$3,000). Estimates are based
                    on recent auction results for comparable items, condition, rarity, and market trends.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Estimates are not guarantees. Final prices may fall below, within, or above the estimate
                    range depending on bidder interest and competition.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Starting bids are typically set below the low estimate to encourage participation.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Condition and Authenticity</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">All lots are sold as-is. Condition reports describe known flaws, restorations, and wear.
                    However, condition reports are not exhaustive. Buyers are responsible for examining lots and forming
                    their own opinions.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We make every effort to accurately describe and authenticate items, but we do not
                    guarantee attribution, age, or provenance unless explicitly stated. Independent expert opinions are
                    recommended for high-value purchases.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Returns are accepted only in cases of material misrepresentation as described in our
                    Terms of Service.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Buyer's Premium</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">A buyer's premium is added to your winning bid. The premium percentage (typically
                    20-25%) is stated in each auction's terms. This fee is standard in the auction industry and covers
                    operational costs.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Your total purchase price is: Hammer Price (winning bid) + Buyer's Premium + Shipping +
                    Taxes (if applicable).</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Payment</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Payment is due within 7 days of the auction closing. Accepted methods include bank
                    transfer, credit card, and certified check. Payment details are provided in your winning
                    notification email.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Lots will not be released until payment is received in full. Late payments may incur
                    fees or result in account restrictions.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Shipping and Pickup</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Buyers are responsible for arranging and paying for shipping or pickup. We can recommend
                    professional art shippers and packers, but buyers are responsible for coordinating and paying these
                    services directly.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Items must be collected or shipping arranged within 14 days of payment. Storage fees may
                    apply for items left beyond this period.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">International buyers are responsible for customs duties, taxes, and import regulations
                    in their country.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Bidding Limits</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">New bidders or those bidding on high-value lots may be asked to provide additional
                    verification or a deposit before bidding. This protects both buyers and sellers from fraudulent
                    activity.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Bid limits may be applied to accounts with outstanding balances or previous payment
                    issues.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">

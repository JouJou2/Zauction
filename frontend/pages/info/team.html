                <h3 class="mb-3">European Decorative Arts</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Our specialists in European furniture, silver, ceramics, and glass have extensive
                    knowledge of period styles, makers' marks, and regional characteristics. They evaluate condition,
                    authenticity, and provenance for items ranging from the Renaissance through the early 20th century.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Fine Art</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">The fine art department handles paintings, works on paper, and sculpture. Specialists
                    conduct research on attribution, examine technique and materials, and consult auction records and
                    scholarly literature to establish estimates and authenticity.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Asian Art and Ceramics</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">Our Asian art specialists focus on Chinese, Japanese, and Southeast Asian ceramics,
                    works of art, and decorative objects. They assess period, kiln attribution, condition, and cultural
                    significance.</p>

                    marks. They work with independent gemologists and watchmakers when detailed technical evaluation is
                    required.</p>

            <p class="text-graphite text-lg mb-12">A trusted platform for curated timed auctions</p>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Zauction connects discerning collectors with exceptional objects through carefully
                    curated timed auctions. We specialize in antiques, fine art, rare books, ceramics, and collectibles
                    of historical and aesthetic significance.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Our platform combines the accessibility of online bidding with the rigor and expertise
                    of traditional auction houses. Every item offered has been evaluated by specialists and presented
                    with detailed condition reports and provenance documentation.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">We believe that quality surpasses quantity. Rather than overwhelming bidders with
                    endless listings, we focus on thoughtful curation. Each auction is composed of items selected for
                    their authenticity, condition, and cultural value.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Timed auctions allow participants from around the world to bid at their convenience,
                    while maintaining the competitive dynamics and transparency of live sales. Bidding periods are
                    clearly defined, increments are standardized, and all activity is recorded.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Trust and Transparency</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Every lot is accompanied by comprehensive documentation including high-resolution
                    photography, detailed descriptions, condition assessments, and available provenance. We disclose all
                    known restorations, repairs, and imperfections.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Our buyer's premium and fee structure is clearly stated. Payment terms, shipping
                    arrangements, and return policies are outlined before bidding begins. We operate with the same
                    standards of accountability expected of established auction houses.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Expertise</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Our team includes specialists in European decorative arts, Asian ceramics, rare books
                    and manuscripts, fine art, and antique jewelry. Items are evaluated for authenticity, condition, and
                    market value before acceptance into our auctions.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We work with independent experts, conservators, and appraisers when specialized
                    knowledge is required. Authentication reports and third-party evaluations are obtained for items of
                    significant value or uncertain attribution.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">For Collectors</h2>

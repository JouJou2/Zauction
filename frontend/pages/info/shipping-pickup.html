                <h2 class="mb-4">Buyer Responsibility</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Buyers are responsible for arranging and paying for all shipping, packing, and
                    insurance. We do not provide in-house shipping services but can recommend professional art shippers
                    and packing specialists.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Items must be collected or shipping arranged within 14 days of payment clearance.
                    Storage fees may apply for items left beyond this period.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Recommended Shippers</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">We maintain a list of professional art shippers, packers, and freight forwarders who are
                    experienced in handling antiques and fine art. Contact us for recommendations based on your location
                    and the nature of your purchase.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Buyers are responsible for obtaining quotes, coordinating pickup, and paying shippers
                    directly. We are not responsible for shipper performance, delays, or damage during transit.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Packing Standards</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Professional packing is strongly recommended for fragile, valuable, or large items.
                    Proper packing materials and techniques reduce the risk of damage during transit.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you choose to pack items yourself, you assume all risk of damage. We can provide
                    basic packing materials (boxes, bubble wrap, paper) for a fee, but we do not pack items.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Local Pickup</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Local buyers may arrange to collect items in person. Pickup must be scheduled in advance
                    by contacting our support team. We cannot accommodate walk-in pickups.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Pickup hours are typically Monday through Friday, 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Appointments must
                    be confirmed at least 48 hours in advance.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Buyers are responsible for bringing appropriate vehicles and assistance for loading. We
                    do not provide loading services for large or heavy items.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">International Shipping</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">International buyers are responsible for all customs duties, taxes, import fees, and
                    compliance with their country's import regulations.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We can provide export documentation (commercial invoices, certificates of origin) as
                    needed. Buyers must arrange for customs clearance and payment of duties in their country.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Certain items may be subject to export restrictions or require permits. Buyers are
                    responsible for verifying that items can be legally imported into their country before bidding.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Insurance</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Buyers are responsible for insuring items during transit. Most professional shippers
                    offer insurance as part of their service. Verify coverage limits and exclusions before shipping.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Risk of loss transfers to the buyer upon payment clearance. We are not responsible for
                    damage or loss occurring after items leave our facility.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Storage Fees</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Items must be collected or shipping arranged within 14 days of payment. After this
                    period, storage fees of $10 per day (or 1% of the purchase price per week, whichever is greater)
                    will apply.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Extended storage may be arranged by prior agreement. Contact us if you require
                    additional time to arrange shipping.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Damage Claims</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Inspect items carefully before accepting delivery. Note any damage on the shipping
                    receipt and photograph the packaging and item immediately.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Damage claims must be filed with the shipper within the timeframe specified in their
                    terms of service (typically 24-48 hours). We cannot assist with claims for damage occurring during
                    transit.</p>
            </section>
